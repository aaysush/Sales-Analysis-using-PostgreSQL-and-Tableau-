# üåü Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Solution

Welcome to my **Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics Solution**! 
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete data warehousing and analytics system, showcasing my expertise in **data engineering, ETL pipelines, data modeling, and business intelligence**.

---

## üîç Project Overview

I developed an end-to-end data warehouse solution with the following key components:

1. **Data Engineering**: Built a modern data warehouse tailored for analytical workloads.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Designed and implemented efficient pipelines to process and transform raw data.
3. **Data Modeling**: Structured data into fact and dimension tables using the star schema.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Delivered business insights via SQL and interactive dashboards.

This project not only highlights my technical skills but also demonstrates my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

I implemented the **Medallion Architecture**, splitting the data pipeline into three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Transformed and standardized data, ready for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, business-ready data modeled for reporting using a star schema.

### 2Ô∏è Analytics & Reporting

**Objective**: Provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Using SQL, I developed reports and visualizations to:

* Analyze **customer behavior** and trends.
* Identify **top-performing products** and sales metrics.
* Highlight **seasonal sales trends** for better forecasting.

### 3 Iteractive Dashboard
I also created dashboards that enabled stakeholders to interact with the data and gain real-time insights.
